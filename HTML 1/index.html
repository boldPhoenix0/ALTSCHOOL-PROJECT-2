        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Amadi Glory Oyi, am currently working as a data annotator in
          the tech ecosystem, where I've gained valuable firsthand experience in
          AI development foundations. My deep fascination with technology and
          innovation drives me to constantly explore new horizons in the field.
          Currently enrolled in AltSchool's Backend Engineering program, I am
          actively building the technical expertise needed for advanced software
          development. With a clear vision of becoming a globally competitive
          tech professional, I am strategically developing sought-after skills
          in backend engineering and artificial intelligence.

        <h2>Why I Joined AltSchool Africa</h2>
        <p>
          My decision to join AltSchool Africa's School of Engineering,
          specifically in the Backend Engineering program, is driven by my
          profound interest in technology and my desire to be at the forefront
          of innovation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Against all odds, my life is a powerful story of hope and grit.
          <br />Growing up, I faced tough challenges that could have held me
          back, but I chose to fight. Every roadblock became a chance to learn
          and grow stronger. <br />My dreams burned bright, fueling my passion
          to break through barriers. Driven by love for my family and a fierce
          belief in myself, I've pushed past limits that once seemed impossible.
          <br />At a young age, I'm proof that hard work and determination can
          transform any situation. My journey isn't just about personal
          successâ€”it's about showing the world that with courage and
          persistence, anything is possible.

        <h2>My Goals for the School of Engineering Programme</h2>

        <p>
          Stepping into the world of technology through Altschool Africa, I'm
          excited to become a backend engineer who builds the invisible magic
          behind websites and apps. <br />I'll learn how to create the
          behind-the-scenes systems that make digital experiences work smoothly.
          My journey will focus on JavaScript, a powerful programming language
          that helps me build the brain of websites and applications. <br />I'll
          discover how to create pathways for data to move, store information
          securely, and make sure everything runs quickly and safely. From
          understanding how websites talk to databases to creating systems that
          handle thousands of user requests, I'm ready to transform my passion
          into real-world technological solutions.
